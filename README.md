# shooting-trainer-sim

A Rust-based shooting training simulator using the Bevy Engine

## Overview

The purpose of this shooting training simulator is to help users improve their shooting skills in a variety of scenarios. I want it to be completely customizable and free to use, and supports integrations with laser ammo and tracking devices.

Some of the ideas I have:

    Practice with randomized shooting scenarios
    Customize the simulator to fit your specific training needs
    Integrate with external devices for more realistic training
